# A simple NodeJS weather app 

A simple weather app built using Node.js and Express as web framework. It makes an api call to OpenWeatherMap.org to fetch the temperature of the entered location in real time, parses the JSON received and displays the result. It also uses EJS (Embedded Javascript) along with usual HTML and CSS to interact with variables and deliver dynamic HTML pages.
